# ``Heightmap``

Data structures for generating and exposing a height map.

## Overview

This library presents a data structure that stores a two-dimensional array of float values, typically used for representing a height map.
The internal representation of the height map is expected to be a Unit value (0.0 to 1.0), stored (and accessible) as a `Float` value.
